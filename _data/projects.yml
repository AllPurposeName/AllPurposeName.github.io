  goal: >
    In this two week mastery project my team of three made a Slack clone to
    demonstrate websockets, microservices, and asynchronicity. The spin on our
    app comes from real life senseless arguments between two of the developers
    on the team. One moderator, two minutes of discussion, and an irrefutable
    decision later, we were a happy team. We wanted to bring that experience to
    everyone!
  responsibilities: >
    I was the primary Rails developer on this project. I also helped smooth the
    JavaScript development.

  goal: >
    For this three week project we were challenged to pivot a previous project
    of a restaurant into an Etsy-like clothing site. The project was assigned
    halfway through the Turing School program.
  responsibilities: >
    Refactoring the cart, implementing the mailer, pivoting the
    database, and pushing logic down the stack.

  goal: >
    We were given 24 hours to create a mini-tinder clone for developers.
    There were no frontend requirements.
  responsibilities: >
    I was completely responsible for the entire project. Including that great
    css.  The takeaways from this project mostly revolved around technical debt.
    I've learned a few solid implementations of design patterns in rails
    projects, and getting to put them to use to save me time when I really
    needed it felt great. Not given the time to refactor, however, left my
    controllers too fat and the logic of state changing functionality (a state
    machine) for another day.
