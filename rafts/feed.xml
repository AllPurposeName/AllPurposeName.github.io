        <title>The Turing Bar</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had always heard about work culture, but never experienced much of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when I was working in a job I loved, like managing a LAN center or working for a residential solar company, I always felt weighed down from ‘working’. The thought that we, as employees, were forming our own “culture” seemed laughable. No matter how fun the environment or how loose the bosses, putting in hard work always came with an emotional price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, having spent seven intense months surrounded by Turing people, working day in and day out to become the best developers we can be, I’ve come to appreciate culture on a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going into the program I figured the vibe would be somewhere between my college experiences and my professional experiences. I balked at the thought of having teachers and homework again. I had an awful image of a classroom where everyone listens to boring lectures and messes around on their cell phones. I was also reluctant to leave behind a great job with friendly, understanding supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my very first day at Turing, though, every fear or worry I had about the program instantly dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon found out that attending Turing School isn’t a job, so naturally its culture is going to be a bit different. Even now on the day of my graduation, I feel like I have to say this again to really believe it: attending Turing isn’t a job. The hours and hours of hard work and the strict deadlines and the performance reviews make it feel like a job, but it most definitely is not a job. It’s quite the opposite… and not just because you don’t get paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is here because we want to start a new chapter in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all completed the multi-part application, paid tuition, quit our jobs, and many of us relocated for this opportunity alone. The entire student body dove in head first. Together. Belonging to a team is a cornerstone of the curriculum. The atmosphere is extremely can-do and turning-a-new-leaf-y. Turing doesn’t need to institute any mandatory “help other students” policy because everyone is already so empathetic to your struggles. In addition to the cool people who surround you, the instructors are as good as it gets. About half of them have teaching backgrounds and the other half have real world programming backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them have a passion for both teaching and programming, and it shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last line of support, and really the backbone of the Turing network, are the mentors. Most are local, some are Turing graduates, and they are all really great programmers who care enough to invest their time in helping to build better developers. Personally, I have only just survived several assessments and projects due to the last minute help of a mentor at 10:00 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turing is just the right size to have an endless stream of people to help/be helped by, but to also have a personal relationship with every single person. I have come to expect the standards of these kind of relationships and this caliber of people in every aspect of my life. The bar has been set very high for my entire future. I now aspire to make every environment I am a part of more like Turing School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical skills aside, this experience has made me into an uncompromising high-quality-work-culture junkie. Or snob. Either way, as I begin hunting for a job, my list of qualifications for potential employees has grown.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
