2. Gaming not about having fun, about satisfaction--golden moment

#The Golden Moments

  Sometimes in life things fall together in an unexpected way. A way in which everything fits nice and neat and all of the little pieces mesh up exactly how they would in the best of all possible worlds. The first time I experienced this was when I scored four rows simultaneously in Tetris. That was back in '94. The next few years were peppered with golden moments like this one. Watching Cao Cao's loyal servants mourn his death in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Kefka moving the Goddess towers on the floating continent, Dr. Robotnik throwing a METAL SONIC at me!

These moments aren't common and there's good reason. Bringing together
