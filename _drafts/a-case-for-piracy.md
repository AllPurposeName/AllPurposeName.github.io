tldr: Pirating is moral. Being a pirate is not about stealing. Being a pirate is
about enabling systems you would otherwise not support. As a content creator, I
abide the act of piracy.

Piracy is good.
## Money

PSA: I am not an expert and the opinion below is just that, opinion. That said,
  the assertions I make are still well informed, educated, reality-grounded
  theses.

  To start, you misunderstand money. I'm technically right due to some pretty
  lame reasons. Do you know what your money stands for? Is there some precious
  metal behind your dollars or a complex credit situation. Why does a metal have
  value? What is credit? Yeah it's a representation of money, but **how**?

  I can't answer those questions. You probably can't either. And even if you
  can, there are probably more complex questions you can't answer.

  So yeah, we both don't really understand money. But aside from the weird
  technical stuff, I still think you misunderstand money. Money is well
  respected and regarded as something very matter of fact. It is often
  associated with success or intelligence or innovation, but those associations
  are true only with the exceptional examples. For us plebs who aren't
  millionaire entrepreneurs or genius inventors, money is a direct
  representation of our time, labor, and creativity.

  To trade money for services or products, there is an understanding that with
  the given circumstances, your labor/creativity/time are worth whatever you are
  getting. When pirating goods, the pirate is denying the value of the product
  while still taking from the goods' producer. A simple, inaccurate label for
  this would be "stealing".

  So the assumptions we're accepting for this conversation are as follows:

  1. Money is a representation of the effort we put forth to society. The
  accumulation of our productive time, labor, and creativity.
  2. Goods are some sort of product or service which have a value in money
  determined by the producer of the good.
  3. While set at an objective amount of money by the producer, a good's value
  **is** a matter of opinion. There is no true innate value assigned to goods.
  The value is assigned by the producer.
  4. There is a willful agreement when goods are purchased for money. That
  agreement states that the goods are worth their value and you are paying that
  value with money.

  There are two other thoughts which I haven't explained, but we will also
  accept.

  5. The majority of pirates would not ever have purchased the goods they end up
  pirating.
  6. The majority of pirates will purchase goods which they have pirated and
  value at or above the goods' stated value.

  Pirates from now on will refer to this majority of pirates even though I have
  no numbers backing up this 'majority' aside from my own anecdotal evidence
  from being in the community.

## Discussion
  The only discussion I hear about the ethics of internet piracy revolves around
  the question "is it bad?". This is terrible framing. Already pirates are on
  the defensive and must approach the situation far differently than if we were
  speaking from the heart about why we pirate. The accusation begins before the
  discussion.

  This rhetoric is used in many different contexts to try to set the tone for
  who the assumed good guys are and who has to defend their counter-culture
  opinions. "Is homosexuality wrong?", "why should you be worried about Uber
  taking over the world", "why you shouldn't go vegan". The knee-jerk rebuke
  brought on by these questions comes from a place of fear. There is some kind
  of self analyzing which has to happen before even considering the opposing
  viewpoints. Instead the participants on the established side of these
  discussions usually assume the worst about the topic and exude their toxic
  opinions into everyone's faces.

  People who hold opinions counter to the current norm are often characterized
  as being militant or aggressive about their opinion. From my personal
  experience, those stances don't come from unsolicited monologues of moral
  superiority, rather they come as a form of defense. When a friend asks how
  much I paid for some overpriced software and I respond with "oh I pirated it",
  I am not challenging the system and shouting the glory of anarchy and freedom
  from the rooftops. I am, however, inadvertently challenging that friend's
  belief on the ethics of piracy and in doing so making them feel like a sucker.

  If **I** didn't have to pay $299.99 but my friend did, doesn't that make my
  friend look like an idiot? They feel the eye of the other bearing down on
  their current stance on piracy. After all if they are wrong, they are an
  idiot. Right? Well in actuality this decisive inner dialogue doesn't really
  occur every time piracy is brought up, but even a subtle challenge of
  someone's worldview can trigger an angry response which boils down to "I don't
  want to deal with this difficult situation right now".

## Back to Money

  I'd rather go into specific examples than get out of my league delving deep
  into economical systems, so I'll try to keep this bit topical. Let's look at
  two real world examples of when I pirated video games: The ~$10 Minecraft
  Alpha which I enjoyed, and the $20.00 Banished which I did not enjoy.

### Minecraft

  In 2009 I discovered Minecraft the same way I discover most games: my brother
  showed me. My brother pirated a copy and sent me the link which I abruptly
  followed for my own copy. Over the next couple years I played A LOT of
  Minecraft. Every major update, Mojang raised the price a handful of dollars.
  Each time I pirated the new edition and continued playing for free. My main
  motivations for this prolonged piracy were that I was poor and I didn't care
  about the paid-only features enough to justify breaking the streak.

  Over this course of free Minecraft years, I was an evangelist. Any friend of
  mine who didn't know about crafting games would get a speech from me about
  this great Minecraft game which impressively uses a procedural random
  generated world and makes up for it's dumb AI by extreme fragility and
  permadeath. I convinced a dozen people to buy the game. I convinced a dozen
  parents that it's a great game for spacial thinking and self-discipline.

  If someone had told my brother back then, "No you *cannot* play Minecraft
  unless you pay the god damned ten dollars!" He would have outright refused and
  moved on to the next thing. If my brother had been in the same situation I
  wouldn't have even heard of Minecraft until years later.

  Since first discovering it in 2009, I've paid full price for my three copies
  of the game and a copy a friend owns. I don't play it anymore. In fact I no
  longer like it. When someone brings it up, however, I happily look back and
  express my appreciation for the game.

### Banished

  In 2014 Banished caught my eye on Steam as a clean looking medieval
  city-builder. The price was steep at $20.00 so I decided to pirate it for my
  girlfriend and myself. We immediately dove in. The version mirrored the
  version on Steam, so we had the same experience we would have had I dropped
  $40.00.

  The game had no goal. It is just a challenge to build a society on a fairly
  limited map.  After 4 hours, my girlfriend had built a village using every
  possible building. There was no challenge left. It had become an exercise in
  tedium and she moved on.

  I came to the same conclusion an hour later. I continued to put in about 15
  more hours to be sure there was no turning point or late game challenges.
  There weren't. I would have been very upset had I just spent $40.00 on such a
  terrible let down.

  I didn't become an evangelist for Banished. There was no convincing of
  friends, conversations with parents, no three copies purchased, no support.

  The only time I ever spoke of the game is when someone else would mention it
  in passing. I wouldn't criticize it exceptionally harshly, but I would always
  say "I'm glad I didn't spend the $20.00 on 4 happy hours."

  Looking back, the creators of Banished asking me for $20.00 is absolutely
  absurd to me. In the most positive light, I would have been spending $1.00/hr
  for their game. Paying one dollar an hour to play an unsatisfactory game is a
  ludicrous rip off when you look at the ~300 hours I've gotten out of the
  $20.00 game Natural Selection 2.

## Analogy

  Imagine you live next to a vast apple orchard. At all times a 10 foot barbed
  wire fence stands between your middle class suburb and the sea of apple trees.
  Most in your community can afford these apples but the only people who ever
  buy them are **extremely** fond of apples. Everyone else just eats whatever
  is convenient at the moment.

  The tragedy about the orchard is that every season the majority of fruit are
  not harvested and fall to the ground to rot. The orchardist wishes the apples
  would sell, but doesn't want to lower the price because they fear the sales
  wouldn't increase and the profits would only decrease.

  One day you find a secret network of tunnels which lead from your neighborhood
  into the orchard. You and a handful of friends take the tunnels from time to
  time to enjoy some free apples. The orchardist eventually discovers the
  tunnel, and has it filled in. Your friends have become hooked on the delicious
  apples and decide to start buying them outright.

  You on the other hand weren't very fond of the apples, so you decide to find a
  tunnel into the peach orchard a few miles away. Your friends are happy to
  follow...
