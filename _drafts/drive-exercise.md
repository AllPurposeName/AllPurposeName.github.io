### In this exercise, we answered 6 questions on motivation derived from Daniel Pink
A link to the gist can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/dynamics/blob/master/drive.markdown)

1. <span class="topic-header">When do you hit your most unconscious flow, where your actions happen almost automatically?</span>

    I usually hit this stride late at night. This led to many all-nighters throughout
    my education at Turing. After graduating, the sleep-schedule-destructive nights
    were the most productive by far. I think this is because I am guaranteed to be
    alone at 3:00 AM so I have no social distractions. Even at Turing during the day
    time I have many people asking for my help and I don't like telling them no because
    I know how crucial it is to both of our development to followthrough and help out.

2. <span class="topic-header">Are there any dangers, problems, or weaknesses with that flow state? Is it healthy?</span>

    It is very dangerous. It is hardly accessable and it completely throws off my
    decent workflow zones for the next few days. It is also extremely unhealthy. I
    sometimes feel my brain hurt in the morning after only an hour or two of sleep.
    I know this, and because of that I only pull it out when it is absolutely necessary.
    Sometimes I kick off a project like that and other times I play catchup with the
    extra hours.

3. <span class="topic-header">What motivates you to work? Why are you here at Turing, in the big picture, and why are you here today in the small?</span>

    Turing's community keeps me honest. During module 3 I committed to a lightning
    talk every week and the only reason I met that goal was because I informed almost
    everyone I came across that I was going to do it. That social responsibility
    weighs heavily on me and I end up doing some great work because of it. The quality
    of those lightning talks is another matter ;)

    I come to Turing in the small because habit and laziness are the greatest of
    enemies. If I have a few hours before lunch and even more after lunch dedicated
    to doing ANY kind of work, I will be much more productive than if lunch is just
    whenever I decide to eat the second meal of the day. My productivity has been
    molded around Turing's structure and that now is a part of me.

4. <span class="topic-header">What's the purpose behind your motivation? We all have a need for survival, but you likely aspire to leave some kind of mark. What is it? Why?</span>

    I wrote about this in a more personal exercise a few weeks ago. I always feel a strong
    urge to leave a legacy I can be proud of. Some of the reason is for pure posterity
    and the other is because I find a bit of immortality in my struggles helping a
    future DJ out. If I even push one person to be their better self, my mark on history
    will be forever present.

5. <span class="topic-header">What undercuts your motivation? When do you struggle to focus or achieve? What excuses do you use to make it ok to fail or procrastinate?</span>

    A big detractor to my motivation is social responsibility. I like reframing the
    situation so my social responsibility aligns with my personal motivation rather
    than subverts it. Sometimes this is not possible or warranted. Usually with my
    fiancee. I've found rather than worry about it or feel bad about failing, I take
    those times as the consequences of my true happiness. To be dedicated is what I
    desired out of this relationship, and now that I have it, something like selfish
    resentment seems laudable.

    Procrastination for me derives mainly from relief. I find relief in very time
    consuming activities such as playing board games, or video games, or watching a
    bunch of talks in a row, or hell, Netflix. The relief is very helpful, but ever
    since Turing it also makes me extremely anxious. Now that I have this great inventory
    of programming skills, I feel like I must use them, let alone the fact that I
    want to use them for so many different things.

6. <span class="topic-header">What helps you do your best work? Why not do these things all the time?</span>

    "My best work" is a mixed bag. I've found some solid progress made in a team, but
    some of the things I'm most proud of were solo work. I've also composed some nice
    code in a one hour period and some nice code over the course of weeks. The pattern
    is hard to pick out, but the consistent things are micro-organization, dedicated
    time blocks, and responsibly putting off unnecessary tasks.

    Micro-organization is a matter of sectioning my work environment off from the
    rest of my world. Opening a new browser window, a new iTerm window, finding a
    nice desk with light, a charger, headphones, etc., maybe even travelling to a
    space where I'm less in demand.

    Dedicated time blocks are a difficult thing for me to deal with in my home
    environment because my fiancee is simultaneously my boss and my secretary. I
    forget a dozen things a week and I scramble to keep up with our social life. If
    I couldn't find the time a few times a week, I would have been washed away with
    the work long ago.

    Acknowledging that something is important, but unnecessary to my current project
    is a definitive anti-pattern. I solve the problem of having too much on my plate,
    but in doing so I stuff my fridge with leftovers until they crash out unexpectedly
    when I finally play catch up. The way to ameliorate this is by tactfully using
    bookmarks, google calendars, and fresh todo lists. Even with these tactics I feel
    like I always have more to read/watch/do forever and ever amen.
