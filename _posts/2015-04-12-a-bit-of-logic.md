tldr: A common mistake I see when people argue is that they don't refute an assertion, instead they bring up another argument entirely.

Take those hypotheticals with a grain of salt...

Imagine a distance between two things, let's say a bed to a window. Now let's say
this bed has been measured to be exactly one meter away from the window. A basic
assertion about the world we instinctively know to be true might be: "this bed is
exactly one meter away from the window". Simple enough and it doesn't really seem
to bring any disputes upon itself except maybe what the definition of "exactly" is.
We won't worry about those semantics though.

One may argue (in my experience they **will** argue) that a measurement of meters,
could be broken down into centimeters, and centimeters broken down into millimeters
and so on. Logically the unit of measurement would eventually shrink until we get
down to something called a [Planck length](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/planck_length).
Trying to conceptualize something smaller than a Planck does not make physical
sense, but could be done to try to make the argument continue forever until it
is agreed that truly there is an infinite distance between the bed and the
window because the scale of the universe is possibly infinite.

This is very similar to a demonstration of "logic and knowledge" from the book
[Thinking About Logic](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-about-Logic-Classic-Essays/dp/0813344697/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_y)--an xmas gift from my girlfriend which
I have been reading. The solution to this logical mistep is in the denial of the
inital assertion. Simply said, to say "the distance could be broken down into
centimeters which could lead to the distance being broken down into
millimeters..." means that you must first **deny** the statement "the bed is exactly
1 meter from the window." The hypothetical about shrinking the universe
infinitely is ridiculous if you admit that yes, the original hypothesis is correct.

For some reason if you do refuse to admit the hypothesis being correct because the
distance of one meter must be proven by smaller units, you are still not negating
the original hypothesis. The hypothesis then just needs finer terms. The phrase
"X is exactly one meter away" is really stating that x is exactly one
"whatever-a-meter-consists-of away". That is to say, if the original meter
assertion is called X₀, then the given centimeter hypothetical can be called X₁ and
so on. Asserting X₀ is also asserting Xn + 1 until you get to the conclusion of
the distance being, in fact, one meter, despite a possible infinitly long regress.

I see this mistep occasionally and it boils down not to a refutation of some
assertion, but a misunderstanding of how to refute an assertion. Inserting a new
argument into the conversation is not actually handling the initial argument, but
starting a new conversation entirely. It's the yak shaving of arguments.
